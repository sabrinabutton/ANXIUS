## Level One:
This level is on a 25x25 grid. There is no mobs or keys on this level because there is already an added level of difficulty. <br>
The entire level is dark, and there is a circle of light around the player that is the only visible portion of the level.

## Level Two:
This level is on a 25x25 grid. There is 3 mobs on this level and 3 keys on this level. You must dodge all of the mobs on this level, as well as obtain all of the keys before you can complete this level. The keys on this level are meant to signify numbers of your locker combo, and when you get all three you can open your locker and move on to the next level.

## Level Three:
This level has two parts. On the first part of the level you must get the key, once you have the key the character is taken to the second part of the level where they must find the door. Throughout this level the character experiences flashbacks to the intial presentation.

## Conclusion:
This level looks impossible, and intially is. However, the point of this level is to show that if you are suffering from this type of mental illness, someone helping can show you the way. Another person would come and help bring you to the door.
