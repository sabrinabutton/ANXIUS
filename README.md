# Anxius
Anxius is a game that follows a boy trapped in the maze of his mind after going into a panic attack. Anxius comments on mental health and the struggles and stigma surrounding it in correspondence with the hackathon's request for the game to follow a civic issue. 

The name "Anxius" is derived from the latin word for anxious (and is *not* a misspelling of anxious).

Programmed for the 2019 Kinaxis Highschool Hackathon by Sabrina Button, Kieran Sutherland, Saad Mazhar & Ryan Diec as submission from A. Y. Jackson Secondary School.
