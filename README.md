## What is ANXIUS
Anxius is a game that follows a boy trapped in the maze of his mind after going into a panic attack. Anxius comments on mental health and the struggles and stigma surrounding it in correspondence with the hackathon's request for the game to follow a civic issue.  

## But Where's the Code?
#### This repository is a *little* messy, so the code is somewhat difficult to locate within the vast collection of music and images. 
The files with code are in main_game  
Javascript File: main.js  
HTML File: Index.html  

I have thankfully adopted much better practices when dealing with repositories since the development of this game - I can use git now!
